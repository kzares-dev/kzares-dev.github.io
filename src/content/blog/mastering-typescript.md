TypeScript has revolutionized how we write JavaScript, providing static typing and advanced tooling. Let's explore how to master this powerful language.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds a layer of type safety to JavaScript, catching errors at compile time rather than runtime. This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

## Basic Types

TypeScript supports various primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and more complex types like interfaces and generics.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function processUser(user: User): void {
  console.log(`Processing ${user.name}`);
}
```

## Generics

Generics allow you to write flexible, reusable code that works with multiple types.

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

const result = identity<string>("Hello");
```

## Advanced Patterns

TypeScript supports decorators, conditional types, and mapped types for advanced use cases. These features enable you to write highly expressive and maintainable code.

Mastering TypeScript will make you a better developer and help you build more reliable applications.
