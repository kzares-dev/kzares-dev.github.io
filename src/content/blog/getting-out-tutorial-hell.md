title: "Getting Out Tutorial HELL"
description: "In programming, it's easy to fall into tutorial hell, where watching tutorials feels productive but hinders real learning. To escape, try replicating a project without looking at the video. If it's tough, reassess your approach. Focus on creating, not just consuming. Work on offline projects to test your skills, then tackle bigger challenges. Building independently is far more rewarding than just following instructions. Embrace effective, autonomous learning"

# Are you facing tutorial hell?
You may not have realized it yet, but tutorial hell is something very difficult to detect, mainly because of the sense of productivity it gives you. Watching tutorial after tutorial will always feel better in the short term than sitting down and struggling with technologies; this is primarily why it is so lethal: ignorance.

Let’s start from the beginning. When you are new to the world of programming, the most popular path is obviously free video tutorials on YouTube, many of which are of high quality, but most just repeat things that have already been said a thousand times, which you don't realize until you have a bit more experience... A similar thing happens with bootcamps, except you pay to go through a course that is nothing more than that—a guide, so to speak—where if you limit yourself to following what they tell you, you will end up just as lost. 

So, can the need to watch tutorial after tutorial to feel productive be avoided? **Obviously yes**, but it's more complicated. You would need to have a very clear vision of the industry or have someone who mentors you correctly. I would dare to say that most people who enter the software field spend some time in this loop, but what’s important is always knowing how to get out of it.

# How to Identify When You're Stuck
I propose a simple exercise: take a tutorial video you have watched recently, ideally one where something is being built. Now try to replicate it on your own, without watching the tutorial. Not being able to do it completely doesn’t mean you’re not in the cycle, but it would be a good indicator. However, if you can’t do much after days, weeks, or months of watching tutorials, that’s a strong indication that you need to make a change. This topic is very subjective, so there’s no way to know for sure, which makes it the most complicated factor.

# How to Get Out
The first and most difficult thing is to detect when you're stuck in the cycle. Once you've done that, the rest is easier. Obviously, I would tell you to stop watching tutorials altogether, at least for a while. But that’s not a viable option; after all, video tutorials provide knowledge. The problem arises when you start consuming them when you don’t need them at all.

What I would do is sit down in front of my computer, without an internet connection—nothing that can provide me with information—and open a new project to work on anything. It doesn’t even have to be an application or something complex; it can be something fun, like a terminal input where you enter your name and surname, or simple things with web interfaces like a landing page. The idea is to keep it as simple as possible and something you can do without the internet. How far you get in this project will determine your current position. You can do this exercise for as long as you want; what’s important is that you understand your situation and your true capabilities.

I would continue doing something similar, now with an ambitious project depending on your skills. You could have internet access to consult blogs and documentation, but only that. Try to aim for a project at a higher level than what you currently have so that you are forced to learn. If you think it’s necessary, do several projects like this.

What happens after this? From now on, you will have realized for yourself, without anyone telling you, that building things on your own is more fun, rewarding, and primarily educational than just watching a video.

I hope this information has been helpful to you. Good luck on your journey!
