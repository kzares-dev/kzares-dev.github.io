React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and how to build your first component.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI when data changes.

## Setting Up Your First Project

To get started, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine. Then, create a new React app using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Understanding Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. There are two types: functional components and class components. Modern React favors functional components with hooks.

## Using Hooks

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The most common hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

React opens up a world of possibilities for building dynamic, interactive web applications. Start with these fundamentals and gradually explore more advanced patterns.
