Docker revolutionizes how applications are deployed. Let's explore containerization.

## What is Docker?

Docker allows you to package applications in containers - isolated environments with all dependencies included.

## Installing Docker

Download Docker Desktop from docker.com and install it on your machine.

## Docker Images and Containers

An image is a blueprint, and a container is a running instance of an image.

## Creating a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t my-app .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app

# List containers
docker ps
```

## Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
```

## Registry and Deployment

Push images to Docker Hub or private registries for easy deployment across environments.

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
