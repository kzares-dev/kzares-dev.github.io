Asynchronous programming is fundamental to modern JavaScript. Async/await provides a cleaner syntax for working with promises.

## What are Promises?

Promises represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future. They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

## From Callbacks to Promises

Before async/await, developers used callback functions, which led to callback hell. Promises provided a better solution.

## Async/Await Basics

Async/await is syntactic sugar over promises. An async function always returns a promise.

```javascript
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Use try/catch blocks to handle errors in async functions, just like synchronous code.

## Parallel Execution

Run multiple promises concurrently using `Promise.all()` for better performance:

```javascript
const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
  fetchUser(1),
  fetchUserPosts(1)
]);
```

## Best Practices

- Don't use async functions unnecessarily
- Avoid unnecessary await in loops
- Use Promise.all() for parallel operations
- Always handle errors

Mastering async/await will make you a much more effective JavaScript developer.
