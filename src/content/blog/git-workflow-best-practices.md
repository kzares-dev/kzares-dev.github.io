Effective Git workflows are essential for team collaboration. Let's explore best practices.

## Branching Strategy

Use a clear branching strategy like Git Flow:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release branches

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Good:
Add user authentication feature
Fix: Correct button alignment on mobile

Bad:
update
fix bug
changes
```

## Pull Request Reviews

Always review code before merging:
- Check for bugs and security issues
- Ensure code follows standards
- Provide constructive feedback

## Keeping History Clean

Use interactive rebase to squash commits before merging:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## Semantic Versioning

Tag releases with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

## Continuous Integration

Integrate Git with CI/CD tools to automatically test and deploy code.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Create and switch to a branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stash changes
git stash

# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

A well-organized Git workflow improves collaboration and code quality.
