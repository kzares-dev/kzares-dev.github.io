CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that revolutionizes how we build web layouts.

## Grid Basics

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system with rows and columns. Define a grid container and place items within it.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Grid Lines

Grid items are positioned using grid lines. You can reference them by number or by name.

```css
.item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 2;
}
```

## Named Grid Areas

Use named areas for more readable layouts:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
```

## Responsive Grid

Create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Auto-Placement

Grid automatically places items if you don't specify their position, making it flexible and powerful.

## Combining with Flexbox

Use Grid for layout and Flexbox for alignment within grid items for the best results.

CSS Grid makes creating complex layouts simple and maintainable.
