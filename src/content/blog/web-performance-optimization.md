Web performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. In this article, we'll explore key optimization techniques.

## Measuring Performance

Before optimizing, measure your current performance using tools like Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or the Chrome DevTools.

## Image Optimization

Images are often the largest assets on a page. Optimize them by:
- Using modern formats like WebP
- Implementing lazy loading
- Serving responsive images with srcset

## Code Splitting

Split your code into smaller bundles that load on demand. This reduces initial load time significantly.

## Caching Strategies

Implement HTTP caching headers and service workers to cache assets effectively. This reduces server requests and improves repeat visit performance.

## CSS and JavaScript Minification

Always minify your CSS and JavaScript in production. Remove unused CSS with tools like PurgeCSS or Tailwind CSS's built-in purge feature.

## Monitoring

Set up performance monitoring to track metrics like:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

By implementing these strategies, you'll create faster, more efficient web applications.
